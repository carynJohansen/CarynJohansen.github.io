My name is Caryn Johansen.

I am a computational biologist and a data scientist. I really enjoy (and am pretty decent at) wrangling data, analyzing that data and constructing statistical models to explain that data, and then visualizing the results in a compelling way.

What really excits me is the sheer abundance of data being generated, both biological data and data about anything else. This presents so many exciting opportunities to understand and improve the world we live in.

Thanks for being here. Quick links below:
