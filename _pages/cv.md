## Current Affiliation

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), Instructor

## Education

*   M.S. Bioinformatics, New York University, NY - __2016__
*   B.S. Biology, Humboldt State University, CA - __2012__

### Previous Affiliations

*   Plant Biology Graduate Group, Ph.D student, U.C. Davis - __2016-2018__

## Technical Experience

__Role of gene expression changes in the adaptation of corn and wild relative teosinte hybrids__

* Examining the effects of hybridization on gene expression patterns in the leaf tissue of corn-teosinte crosses. We noticed that many genes were disregulated in the sense that the gene expression in the offspring was much greater than either of the parents, or much less than either of the parents.
* Advisers: [Dr. Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra](http://www.rilab.org/) & [Dr. Daniel Runcie](http://runcielab.ucdavis.edu/)

* Adviser:
* [more details...]

__Calculating the population branch statistic between cultivars of corn and teosinte__

* Advisers:

__The Rice Data Center: a multi-feature data analysis tool for _Oryza sativa_ genetic, proteomic, and regulatory interaction network data__

* a full-stack, custom built database and interactive data visualization created with the purpose to search five years worth of genomic, proteomic, and analysis of different rice populations from the Purugganan lab at NYU.
* Adviser: [Dr. Michael Purugganan](http://puruggananlab.bio.nyu.edu/)
