## Work Experience and Projects

**Data Scientist Contractor** • February 2018 - present

* Minotaur Inc.; San Francisco, CA
* Building a bioinformatics pipeline in **R**, **Linux**, and **Python** for Minotaur Inc. to make their gene discovery pipeline scalable and fast
* Building **predictive models** to infer plant metabolite presence or absence
* **Mining** public metabolic, proteomic, and genomic databases to identify new possible discoveries for plant metabolic products
* Working closely with a small team of computational biologists and analytical chemists to produce a written report on results and proof-of-concept computational infrastructure

**PhD graduate student** • September 2016 - December 2017

* U.C. Davis; Davis, CA
* Advisors: Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra & Daniel Runcie
* Focus: statistical genetics and population genetics
* Constructed **statistical models** in **R** to understand the gene expression differences between populations of corn and corn's wild relative, teosinte
* Utilized **Bayesian statistics models** in **R** to generate informative gene clusters in corn to better understand how environment impacts gene expression
* Designed field experiments based on **simulations** in **R** to test the hypothesis that hybrids of diverged populations of corn in Mexico had dis-regulated genes that may contribute to speciation between species
* Conducted genome wide association mapping in **Linux** and **R** on 503 corn hybrids using **mixed linear models** to identify genetic loci associated with certain agronomic phenotypes

**Bioinformatics Contractor** • January 2016

* Hampton Creek Foods, Inc.; San Francisco, CA
* Worked with the R&D team constructing an in-house plant protein discovery pipeline
* Built a tool in **R** to enable the team to feed in raw data output from a machine to bypass the point and click software available 

**Teaching Assistant** • August 2015 - December 2015

* New York University Tandon School of Engineering; New York, NY
* Course: Next Generation Sequence Analysis
* Provided technical and course-related assistance to educate students on processing big genomic data sets using current biological software tools

**Research Assistant** • June 2015 - August 2015

* New York University; New York, NY
* Built a **SQL** database in **Python** to host five years of data on protein function predictions and transcriptional regulatory interactions in the _Oryza_ genus
* Built the front end in **JavaScript** and network visualizations with **D3.js** for the relational database, called The Rice Data Center
* This tool enabled search five years worth of genomic, proteomic, and analysis of different rice populations with the purpose to answer questions, to reduce redundant use of research funds, to inform new hypotheses, and to inspire future research

**Research Assistant** • June 2012 - July 2014

* Carnegie Institute for Science, Department of Plant Biology; Stanford, CA
* Adviser: Dr. Seung Rhee
* Conducted research on the impact of salt stress impact on reproductive success and root architecture in _Arabidopsis thaliana_. Developed lab protocols to analyze sodium ion distribution in plant tissues.

## Project Details

__Role of gene expression changes in the adaptation of corn and wild relative teosinte hybrids__

* Examining the effects of hybridization on gene expression patterns in the leaf tissue of corn-teosinte crosses. We noticed that many genes were disregulated in the sense that the gene expression in the offspring was much greater than either of the parents, or much less than either of the parents.

__Use of a Bayesian sparse factor gibbs sampler to identify gene clusters__

__Calculating the population branch statistic between cultivars of corn and teosinte__

__The Rice Data Center: a multi-feature data analysis tool for _Oryza sativa_ genetic, proteomic, and regulatory interaction network data__

* Built a full-stack, custom built database and interactive data visualization created with the purpose to search five years worth of genomic, proteomic, and analysis of different rice populations from the Purugganan lab at NYU.
