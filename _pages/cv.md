## Description

Caryn Johansen is a **computational biologist** and **data scientist**.  
As a computational biologist she has more than four years experience designing and implementing bioinformatics pipelines for genomic analysis, and using a variety of **statistical** and **machine learning** tools for genetic analyses.
As a data scientist, she works with data from a range of fields both in and outside of biology, and is an expert at **wrangling data** in **R**, creating **statistical models**, and **visualizing** compelling results.

## Achievements

__Built__ maize genetics work flows during my Ph.D work to analyze the genomics and traits of maize quickly and effectively.

__Indentified__ differential gene expression patterns in corn and teosinte hybrids using linear mixed models.

__Built__ a relational database and interactive user interface for research laboratory at NYU for researchers to quickly query and visualize the results of five years worth of data collection.

__Certified__ as a Data Carpentry Instructor, to help teach academics and others the basics computational tools of data analysis.

## Technical Experience

__Role of gene expression changes in the adaptation of corn and wild relative teosinte hybrids__

* Examining the effects of hybridization on gene expression patterns in the leaf tissue of corn-teosinte crosses. We noticed that many genes were disregulated in the sense that the gene expression in the offspring was much greater than either of the parents, or much less than either of the parents.

__Use of a Bayesian sparse factor gibbs sampler to identify gene clusters__

__Calculating the population branch statistic between cultivars of corn and teosinte__

__The Rice Data Center: a multi-feature data analysis tool for _Oryza sativa_ genetic, proteomic, and regulatory interaction network data__

* Built a full-stack, custom built database and interactive data visualization created with the purpose to search five years worth of genomic, proteomic, and analysis of different rice populations from the Purugganan lab at NYU.
