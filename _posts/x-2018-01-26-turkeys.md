Intro

Data from data.world [makeover monday](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018-w-4-turkey-vulture-migration-in-north-and-south-america)

Data originally from [movebank](https://www.movebank.org/)

And published here: http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1643/20130195

Set Up
---


```r
library(tidyverse)
```


Data
---

```r
turkeys <- read.delim("data/Turkey vultures in North and South America - migration.csv", sep = ",", header=T)
```

# Clean and first glances

Columns I just don't need: study.name


```r
turkeys <- turkeys %>% select(-study.name)
```

Any NAs?


```r
dim(turkeys)
```

```
## [1] 220077     31
```

```r
dim(turkeys[complete.cases(turkeys),])
```

```
## [1] 156718     31
```

Two methods to look for NAs here - `summary()` and `complete.cases()`. Summary can be overwhelming, and I initially missed the NAs in the summary. The tip off is that the dimensions of `turkeys` and of the subset of complet cases of `turkeys` does not match. Let's figure out why.


```r
dim(turkeys)[1] - dim(turkeys[complete.cases(turkeys),])[1]
```

```
## [1] 63359
```

```r
# looks like all the missing values might be 

missing_turkeys <- turkeys[!complete.cases(turkeys),]
summary(missing_turkeys)
```

```

I'm going to leave these in for now, because all the NAs are only associated with not having a turkey's mass. I don't think that will matter for my analysis, which is focused on migratory pathes. If mass comes in to the picture, I will deal with the NAs.

### Individuals and Samples

What is the relationship between "individual.local.identifier" and the "event.id", "study.id", etc.



```r
turkeys %>% ggplot(aes(x=animal.life.stage, fill=individual.local.identifier)) + geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  facet_wrap(~animal.id)
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

So "individual.local.identifier" == "animal.id", and "tag.local.identifier" is probably an integer id.

**Except** it looks like there may be trouble with Butterball and Schaumboch.


```r
turkeys %>% ggplot(aes(x=animal.life.stage, fill=as.factor(tag.local.identifier))) + geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  facet_wrap(~animal.id)
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

Cool, **now I have several useful methods to identify individuals.** I'll have to keep in mind that Butterball and Schaumboch may be compromised. For now though, I'd like to explore the data more.

From this, I can see some individuals were sampled more often than others.

Locations
---

Each sample comes with latitude and logitude information.

These samples were taken from four different study regions:


```r
table(turkeys$study.site)
```

```
## 
## East Coast of North America   Interior of North America 
##                       64260                       55882 
##   Interior of South America West Coast of North America 
##                       22548                       77387
```



```r
turkeys %>% ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y = location.lat, color=study.site)) + geom_point()
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

This is a map-less way of looking at the regions just based on their lat and longitude.

Time analysis

## West Coast Birds

Initially, I am going to just look at one group. The West coast group, because that's where I live and I am acquanted with some of these turkies.


```r
westies <- turkeys %>% filter(study.site == "West Coast of North America")
```

Which glorious individuals live in the west coast?


```r
table(westies$animal.id)
```

```
## 
##    Argentina   Butterball       Disney      Domingo         Irma 
##            0            0            0            0            0 
##     La Pampa          Leo          Mac         Mark         Mary 
##            0            0            0            0            0 
##      Morongo        Prado      Rosalie       Sarkis   Schaumboch 
##        19868        20967        28101         8451            0 
## Steamhouse 1 Steamhouse 2       Whitey   Young Luro 
##            0            0            0            0
```

We have four animals, Morongo, Prado, Rosalie, and Sarkis.

Let's check out Sarkis' path:


```r
westies %>% filter(animal.id == "Sarkis") %>% ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat)) + geom_path()
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

What about all of their paths?


```r
westies %>% ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat, color=animal.id)) + geom_path()
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

So here are some things to do:

* There is seasonality and direction to these movements. Add in the time layer.
* Put this on a map, with a scale

## Time Layer

I'm going to tackle the time layer today, and the map layer next week.


```r

library(lubridate)
```

Parse the date column using the `parsedate` package:


```r
fulldate <- parse_iso_8601(westies$timestamp)
datesplit <-  t(as.data.frame(strsplit(as.character(fulldate), split = " ")))
rownames(datesplit) <- NULL
colnames(datesplit) <- c("date", "hour")
westies <- cbind(datesplit, westies)
westies <- westies %>% mutate(month = month(date, label=TRUE))
```

Add time layer to individual:


```r
westies %>% filter(animal.id == "Sarkis") %>% ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat, color=month, group=animal.id)) + geom_path(alpha = 0.7)
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

So it looks like Arkis hangs out at the north end of its range February through September, and at the south end of the range November through January. It migrates during February and October, with some wandering during March.


```r
westies %>% ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat, color=month, group=animal.id)) + geom_path(alpha = 0.7)
```

In general, we can see that this is true for all four of these birds - south in the winter and north in the spring and summer. 

That is, you know, what we exect in the northern hemisphere. So that's good!

### Prado's range

But dude, what is Prado doing?


```r
westies %>% filter(animal.id == "Prado") %>% ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat, group=animal.id, color=month)) + geom_path()
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)<!-- -->

Prado clearly does not migrate.

We could also see that by just quickly summarizing  the ranges of each bird:


```r
westies %>% group_by(animal.id) %>%
  summarise(long_min = min(location.long), long_max = max(location.long), lat_min = min(location.lat), lat_max = max(location.lat) )
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 5
##   animal.id  long_min   long_max  lat_min  lat_max
##      <fctr>     <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
## 1   Morongo -123.6838  -90.65983 14.69767 43.60800
## 2     Prado -118.0558 -117.08900 33.52117 34.02400
## 3   Rosalie -123.9255 -107.16650 25.49967 46.64167
## 4    Sarkis -121.0138 -108.32317 26.21600 36.21050
```


```r
westies %>% ggplot(aes(x=animal.id, y = location.long)) + geom_boxplot()
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
westies %>% ggplot(aes(x=animal.id, y = location.lat)) + geom_boxplot()
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-2.png)<!-- -->

This is definitely not the correct use of latitude and longitude data, but I can quickly see that Prado is not migratory (or I could have looked at the data set, but hey! this is about visualizing.)

I bet you that Prado is a Davis, CA turkey. Next time we'll find out with maps!

## Seasonal Migration

So looking at the month could provide direction - and I may have to re-classify. But let's also look at the year.


```r
westies <- westies %>% mutate(year = year(date))
westies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat, group=animal.id, color=as.factor(year))) +
  geom_path(alpha = 0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~animal.id)
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)<!-- -->

So we're limited by data here, but over all, it looks like the turkeys have been very consistent over the years with their migratory patterns, except Morongo in 2008. It looks like Morongo got stuck somewhere.

Rosalie, who also has the most data points, is the most consistent with her migration patterns.

## South American Turkeys

Let's check out some south american turkeys.


```r
southAm <- turkeys %>% filter(study.site == "Interior of South America")
table(southAm$animal.id)
```

```

##            0            0         3565         7658
```

Get time data


```r
fulldate <- parse_iso_8601(southAm$timestamp)
datesplit <-  t(as.data.frame(strsplit(as.character(fulldate), split = " ")))
rownames(datesplit) <- NULL
colnames(datesplit) <- c("date", "hour")
southAm <- cbind(datesplit, southAm)
southAm <- southAm %>% mutate(month = month(date, label=TRUE), year = year(date))
```


```r
southAm %>% ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y = location.lat, group=animal.id, color=animal.id)) + geom_path() +
  facet_wrap(~year)
```

I like La Pampa's adenturous spirit.


```r

  facet_wrap(~animal.id)

## Some time for all Turkeys


```r
fulldate <- parse_iso_8601(turkeys$timestamp)
datesplit <-  t(as.data.frame(strsplit(as.character(fulldate), split = " ")))
rownames(datesplit) <- NULL
colnames(datesplit) <- c("date", "hour")
turkeys <- cbind(datesplit, turkeys)
turkeys <- turkeys %>% mutate(month = month(date, label=TRUE), year = year(date))
```


```r
turkeys %>% filter(animal.comments != "non-migratory") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat, group = animal.id, color=as.factor(year))) +
  geom_path() +
  facet_wrap(~study.site, scale="free")
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png)<!-- -->

Probably should have done this first. It looks as though the East Coast data does see some consistent variation between years. but also probably because it's been doing it the longest.

## Migration

One last visualization for this one. 


```r
turkeys %>% filter(study.site == "East Coast of North America") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=location.long, y=location.lat, group=animal.id, color=animal.id)) +
  geom_path(alpha = 0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~year)
```

![](/assets/images/sketch4-turkeys_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)<!-- -->
Disney's migratory route changed a bit. Now sure where Butterball is, but that data was potentially mixed up with Schaumboch's data.

It looks like there were two groups of turkeys on the east coast - and it looks like Mark is a turn-coat.
